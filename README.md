Analyzing the contents of (almost) every National Geographic magazine since its inception in 1888. 

## Exploration

Before I started with any specific question in mind, I set out to explore Nat Geo's online archive with an open mind. I didn't know what kind of data might be behind the website or if there would be any at all that's visible to the public - only that I wanted to find something interesting.

<img src="https://github.com/justinperline/natgeocoverage/blob/master/NatGeoCover.png" width="34%" align="right">

The first step I take nowadays is always checking Google Chrome's network page for any JSON files. Fortunately, Nat Geo keeps both an archive of every issue's metadata and additional data on the contents of each individual issue. Within each issue, there is information relating to an article's title, abstract, and page number. This even extends to tons and tons of photos, department notices, and editors notes.

There is also a folio breakdown that lists the order of pages within each issue - something that may be interesting to look at down the road. How did Nat Geo's page layout with respect to ad space change over time? Or something along those lines.

Unfortunately, Nat Geo is pretty spotty with their data management. As of December 2019, there have been 1,522 issues made and 50 of them (~3.3%) lack any JSON data to tell what is inside. Another 42 issues (~2.8%) have fewer than 5 tagged articles, photos, or other pages. The magazine issues with missing data are oddly clustered, with 45 of 50 falling from 2010-2014, 2 in 1992-1993, and the remaining 3 from 1893-1895. On the whole though, most issues have 150 or so well-defined tags listing the exact details of each article or photo. 

The breakdown of metadata (out of the 1,472 with JSON) is as follows.

<table>
<thead><tr"><th></th><th>All</th><th>Articles</th><th>Photos</th><th>Other</th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>Max</td><td>996</td><td>23</td><td>982</td><td>24</td></tr>
 <tr><td>75th Percentile</td><td>223</td><td>7</td><td>212</td><td>3</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Median</td><td>167</td><td>6</td><td>158</td><td>1</td></tr>
 <tr><td>25th Percentile</td><td>61</td><td>4</td><td>55</td><td>0</td></tr>
 <tr><td>>= 1 Issues</td><td>1,472</td><td>1,459</td><td>1,365</td><td>846</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Total</td><td>225,828</td><td>8,407</td><td>213,049</td><td>4,372</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Avg</td><td>153.4</td><td>5.7</td><td>144.7</td><td>3.0</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>


So the bulk of Nat Geo's metadata is really in the photos. However, the photo titles are the only information immediately available and they are much shorter in length than article titles and abstracts (an average of 29 characters vs. 203). For the time being, I think it'd be wise to solely focus on the 8,407 tagged articles spanning the last century.

Example of photo title:

`Babasaki Gate, Tokyo, Japan`

Example of article title and abstract:

`Ascension Island, an Engineering Victory : Located halfway between South America and Africa, the tiny, bird-covered volcanic island of Ascension is a vital military refueling station with an airfield.`

## Asking Questions

Before digging into the text just yet, how about looking at simply the magazine itself over time? National Geographic <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2016/09/geographic-magazine-natgeo-first-hubbard-greely-1888/">began as more of a scientific journal</a> than a modern-day magazine, containing lengthy written passages on American surveying and geography. The first "photo" (a map of North America) appeared two issues later, and it wasn't until 1959 that a photo even appeared on the cover. Now Nat Geo is <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2013/10/01/227871549/national-geographic-celebrates-125-years-of-photography">synonymous with photographic achievement</a>.

Another clear difference between the original magazine and today's is its length. Up until the year 1900, Nat Geo averaged just under 58 pages per issue. This was followed by a steep increase in length through 1925, gaining an average of about 6 pages a year, which coincided with a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/01/0127national-geographic-society-founded/">change in editorial preferences</a> geared towards making the magazine more accessible and photo-heavy. And that's been right about where the magazine has settled in the century that has followed, hovering right around 165-180 pages.

Now returning to the article data that we've scraped, I see a few different avenues of research ahead. We have three pieces of data: the title and abstract of almost every article Nat Geo has ever released in print, when it was released, and what page the article was on. Let's ignore the page numbers for now and just focus on what questions can be drawn from text and dates. Since Nat Geo has predominantly been a global publication, we can think of most articles as being associated with at least one specific country. Whether it's an analysis of Rwanda's future or a dive into the Brazil-French Guiana border situation, it seems that one identifiable tag could be a country's name.

To test this theory, I automatically paired all applicable countries to every Nat Geo article's text (a combined title and abstract field) and wound up with a surprising number of matches. In total, 4,883 country tags were created pertaining to 3,890 unique articles, an average of ~1.3 countries per article. A few articles even had 5 countries mixed in, like <a href="https://archive.nationalgeographic.com/national-geographic/1966-dec/flipbook/Ad23/">this Dec. 1966 essay</a>:
`Abraham, the Friend of God : Following in the footsteps of the Old Testament patriarch who conceived the idea of one almighty God, the author pursues legend that is history from Iraq to Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Egypt, and Jerusalem.`

With this in mind, let's see if we can answer any of these questions:

**Has National Geographic's coverage of each continent changed over time?**

**At what frequency does National Geographic cover each country?**

**Does National Geographic cover countries proportionately to how populated they are? If not, what's driving coverage?**

## Continental Drift

Datahub.io provides a handy <a href="https://datahub.io/JohnSnowLabs/country-and-continent-codes-list">file</a> that, along with listing every modern-day country, also provides their continents. Now, a few disclaimers about how countries have been tagged and how that may or may not affect the result to follow.

1. Countries with variations in spelling had both versions added then re-combined after tagging (e.g., `CÃ´te d'Ivoire` & `Ivory Coast`)
2. Some countries are admittedly impossible to differentiate via automated text search (e.g., `Democratic Republic of the Congo` & `Republic of the Congo`). In these cases, all text with `Congo` was assigned just one country.
3. Nat Geo has been around a while and a lot has changed since 1888. Burma became Myanmar, Korea split into North and South, Yugoslavia was created then dissolved, a large majority of Africa was under colonial rule, etc. The world was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_1900">very different back then</a> and it's harder still to trace every country's names over the past 131 years. That's why I've only used modern-day countries in this search, which could drastically affect how often certain countries appear in the results. I think this is likely the largest challenge 
4. A few countries have naming issues that required manual editing. Five were simple liking removing references to `Dominica` when the text actually said `Dominican Republic` (e.g. `Nigeria`, `Papua New Guinea`) while others meant surfing through every tagged reference to `India` to make sure Nat Geo wasn't referencing Native Americans (e.g. `Georgia`, `Chad`).
5. Several countries are listed as being members of two continents (e.g. `Armenia`, `Turkey`), so for this continental breakdown both instances were kept. When talking about the countries themselves later on, only one instance is kept.

<img src="https://github.com/justinperline/natgeocoverage/blob/master/NatGeoContinents.png" width="100%">

After plotting every continent's reference totals in Tableau, we get something like this. Keep in mind, the US has been removed from this dataset because there are just so many references to America that it's difficult to compare North America against any other continent.

It seems that, on the whole, the rate at which Nat Geo writes about various continents has stayed somewhat consistent. Fewer articles have been written about Europe since the mid-20th century, and I would speculate much of the interest from 1910-1950 was drawn from the World Wars. In Europe's place, more articles have been written about African and Asian countries lately and I'd expect that trend to continue as those countries grow in population. However, I think it's difficult to read too much into these figures without first looking at individual country coverage, which leads to the next question - what countries have been covered the most?

## Country Coverage

<img src="https://github.com/justinperline/natgeocoverage/blob/master/NatGeoCountries.png" width="100%">

Looking at every country on a map, it's easy to tell who the primary subjects of National Geographic have been - namely the United States, United Kingdom, China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, and Russia. 5 of the 11 most populated countries on Earth, both of America's closest neighbors, 5 members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight">Group of Eight</a>, etc. The next three countries by reference numbers are: Australia, India, and France. 

To some extent, these countries make sense. They have generally been at the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/best-international-influence">forefront of international news</a> because of how influential are, and also have been throughout recent history. Conversely, if you were to assume coverage numbers would be based mostly off of current population size (as some proxy for historical population size), just look at where Pakistan, Indonesia, and Nigeria fall. In total, these three countries represent about 8.8% of all people and yet they've only been referenced in Nat Geo 21, 30, and 10 times, respectively. They also place much lower on the US News report ranking countries by how "influential" they are. 

But there's something else driving reference numbers here. Just look at Antarctica (if you want to call it a country), which has the 19th most references despite a population of about 1,000 and zero influence to speak of. The third factor has to relate to something besides the country itself and what it *was* thought of by other countries prior to publication. I'm using the past tense here because I think Nat Geo's stories have shifted global perceptions of countries over time. I believe this is an approximation of a location's 'wonder', which is a nice way of terming a combination of exoticism and archaeological attainment.

National Geographic has a contentious past when it comes to its coverage of other countries, something the magazine's editor in chief, Susan Goldberg, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/04/from-the-editor-race-racism-history/">has very much admitted</a>. Editors had a history of portraying native peoples and those of less-developed nations as exotic rarities that can be marveled at from 10,000 miles away, and it's easy to imagine how that would have sold copies. That's why it might make sense why Papua New Guinea would have the 27th most references of all countries even though it's the 101st most populated. 

Similarly, archaeological findings explain much of the coverage for two well-positioned countries. Egypt and Peru, the 11th and 12th most referenced countries are rich in well-preserved history. Egypt's history has an entire field of study devoted to it, not to mention the only wonder of the ancient world that's still standing. Meanwhile, Peru saw explorer Hiram Bingham uncover the site of Machu Picchu (to the rest of the world) and subsequently return several times with <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/1913/04/machu-picchu-peru-inca-hiram-bingham-discovery/">the backing of the National Geographic society</a>. Both of these countries benefit from the presence of such well-known ancient history.

To see a full list of countries by reference numbers, see the 'countriesReferences.csv' document. 

This map was made in Tableau with the <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/">viridis color palette</a>, and despite my <a href="https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2015/08/24/when-to-use-maps-in-data-visualisation-a-great-big-guide/">reservations about creating maps simply to display country-level data</a>, I thought this would be the best way to easily reference the general tier of each country in a short space. Just remember North Korea as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo are missing on this map for reasons cited above, but their counterparts - South Korea and the Republic of the Congo - contain all references to them as well. 

# Making a Model

No need to get too fancy with the model just yet, as the only piece of external data I have at the moment is modern-day population figures. I have a few ideas for sources of additional data that might be factors in Nat Geo's coverage, but I'll save that until the end.

<img src="https://github.com/justinperline/natgeocoverage/blob/master/NatGeoPopModel.png" width="70%" align="left">

I'm running a simple linear model predicting reference numbers based off of <a href="https://datahub.io/JohnSnowLabs/population-figures-by-country">Datahub.io's population datasheet</a> and removing the following countries because of the disclaimers already brought up: USA, North Korea, South Korea, Democractic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo.

Overall, the fit isn't half bad with an R^2 of **0.26**. So there is some actual signal that comes from a country having more or less people. Of course, keep in mind that this is modern-day (2016) population data paired against modern-day country names, and does not account for past populations that may have changed in rank order.

# Data Hungry

I think there are better ways to model this effect and the best way to do so begins with better data, starting off with attempting to include former country names (and former country's names). Then, modeling using a country-year aggregate (e.g. 1971 France) would result in a more accurate understanding of what kind of coverage might be expected, especially because this could be paired with more representative population data.

I'd also like to incorporate more data that could explain some of the assumptions I made in regards to what drives coverage: country influence, exoticism, and archaeological attainment. These are ambiguous terms right now that I hope to solidify in the future.

Using the actual US News influence report could be interesting, but it only extends to 80 countries. Counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Sites_by_country">World Heritage</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_archaeological_sites_by_country">archaeological sites</a> by country may also hold some clues. If you happen to know of any interesting datasets (whether already in a file format or just spread out online) that could help proxy these concepts, or if you have other ideas as to what's been a driver of National Geographic's coverage, don't hesitate to reach out: *jtperline@gmail.com*.
