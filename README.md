Analyzing the contents of (almost) every National Geographic magazine since its inception in 1888. 

## Exploration

Before I started with any specific question in mind, I set out to explore Nat Geo's online archive with an open mind. I didn't know what kind of data might be behind the website or if there would be any at all that's visible to the public - only that I wanted to find something interesting.

The first step I take nowadays is always checking Google Chrome's network page for any JSON files. Fortunately, Nat Geo keeps both an archive of every issue's metadata and additional data on the contents of each individual issue. Within each issue, there is information relating to each article's title, abstract, and page number. This even extends to tons and tons of photos, department notices, and editors notes.

There is also a folio breakdown which lists the order of pages within each issue.
